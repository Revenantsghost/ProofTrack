# ProofTrack
UW CSE403 Project
Summary
The goal of this app is to provide a productivity platform that requires users to capture pictures and/or videos of their practice sessions to hold themselves accountable.
This would prevent users from forming new habits without following through with them. 
The notifications and reminders to practice often would motivate users to keep up with their goals, as well as allowing them to revisit their progress over time. 

Abstract
“Practice is everything” – Periander
We all know that consistent practice is the cornerstone of developing any new skill. Setting aside regular times to practice is crucial for growth—but let’s face it, just adding a reminder to your calendar or setting a recurring alarm often falls flat. Without a coach or instructor, it’s far too easy to dismiss those alerts and move on. 
But what if there was an app that not only reminded you to practice, but actually held you accountable? Imagine an app that requires you to capture a photo, video, or audio recording of your practice session before you can dismiss the day’s reminder. This is more than just an alarm clock; it's a personal accountability partner that keeps you on track and motivated.
In addition, this app lets you visually track your progress over time. Not only can you see a calendar showing which days you completed your practice, but you can also revisit each day’s effort to see just how far you’ve come. It’s like having a timeline of your growth—transforming your practice sessions from routine to rewarding.


Goal
The goal of this app is to provide a productivity platform that requires users to capture pictures and/or videos of their practice sessions to hold themselves accountable. This would prevent users from forming new habits without following through with them. The notifications and reminders to practice often would motivate users to keep up with their goals, as well as allowing them to revisit their progress over time. 


Current Practice
This app is similar to Alarmy, an alarm clock which requires the user to prove they are
awake by completing “missions” before the alarm can be dismissed.
There are also a number of apps which use monetary commitments or community review to ensure that the user is meeting goals. This is similar to traditional coaching, which is a proven way to learn, but which has associated costs and the downside of creating a feeling of pressure which might discourage users.


Novelty
The twist for ProofTrack is how it requires the user to provide proof of practice. By capturing a post-workout selfie, a recording of a song played on guitar, or a video of the user skateboarding, the user is pushed to document their progress beyond a boring check mark with tangible evidence of their work and growth.


Effects
If successful, this software would help users to stick to a consistent routine while cultivating new talents. The ability to revisit their growth over the course of previous sessions would help them to celebrate their improvement over time.
