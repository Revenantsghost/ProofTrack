Rules for Communication: 
  - Effective Communication
      - Use clear, direct language in all communications. Avoid jargon unless everyone on the team understands it.
  - Use the Right Channels
      - Use Discord and/or Text message for questions or updates regarding the project.
      - Meetings: Use Discord voice calls or schedule in person meetings for progress updates and brainstorming sessions.
  - Document Important Decisions
      - Record decisions on features, code structure, or timelines in a shared document (Google Docs).
      - Ensure everyone has access to these documents.
  - Be Respectful and Constructive
      - Critique code or ideas, not individuals!
      - Offer suggestions and solutions rather than just pointing out problems.
  - Respond in a Timely Manner
      - Respond to messages or requests within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 24 hours for non-urgent matters).
      - If you need more time to reply, acknowledge the message and try to respond later.
  - Ask for Clarifications Early
      - If something isn’t clear, ask for clarification as soon as possible to avoid delays.
      - Ask questions early rather than making assumptions.
  - Keep Everyone Updated
      - Post regular updates on your progress in the team’s discord chat and participate during in-person meetings
      - If you encounter challenges, notify the team as soon as possible.
  - Respect Deadlines
      - Set realistic deadlines and respect them. If you are experiencing any delays, inform the team well in advance.
      - If you need an extension, communicate why and propose a new deadline.
  - Hold Regular Check-ins
      - Regular team check-ins (In-class Tuesdays and Thursdays, online Discord calls) to discuss progress, challenges, and goals.
      - Ensure everyone has a chance to contribute and share feedback.
  - Be Inclusive in Communication
      - Ensure all team members, regardless of skill level, feel included in discussions and decision-making processes.
      - Avoid making major decisions without consulting project manager (TA David).
  - Handle Conflicts Professionally
      - Address conflicts or disagreements calmly and respectfully. Focus on finding a solution that benefits the project.
  - Use Version Control Properly
      - Follow agreed-upon Git practices (e.g., branching, commit messages) and communicate when pushing significant changes to the repository.
