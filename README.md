# ProofTrack
UW CSE403 Project
The goal of this app is to provide a productivity platform that requires users to capture pictures and/or videos of their practice sessions to hold themselves accountable.
This would prevent users from forming new habits without following through with them. 
The notifications and reminders to practice often would motivate users to keep up with their goals, as well as allowing them to revisit their progress over time.
